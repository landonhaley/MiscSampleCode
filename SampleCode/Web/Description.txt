These two files are extracted from a web application I built this summer for SAIC, which was developed as a means to improve the design process for simulation and serious game development.  I chose these two files to represent my proficiency in web-based languages because they use a combination of JSON, AJAX, JQuery, JavaScript, PHP, and XML to reach a common goal.  In the JavaScript file, I used AJAX to send and request information from the php file.  Using PHP, I pulled XML-formatted information from a database.  I then organized each each individual piece of information based on itâ€™s XML tag.  Using JSON, I echoed the organized information back to the JavaScript file and there I parsed the response.
